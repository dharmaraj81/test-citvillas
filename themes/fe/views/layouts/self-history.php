<p> Once upon a time, an Australian girl moved to Italy in search of ‘ la dolce vita’ (the sweet life). She fell in love with Tuscany and the Italian way of life - all the little things, the flavours and scents, the noises and habits of a country and people rich in traditions, who knew how to live a good simple life. This new life filled her with joy and she decided to share it with fellow travellers and experience seekers and so started a collection of Italian villa rentals called Ciao Italy Villas.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> In 2015, Ciao Italy Villas became CIT Villas, owned and run by Peter &amp; Kate Newsom, a family team who, with the same passion for sharing travel experiences, continue to grow and showcase the very best collection of Italian villas and travel experiences available to travellers from Australia and around the world. </p>
